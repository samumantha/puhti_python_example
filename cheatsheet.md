# CSC and Unix cheatsheet
adapted from https://docs.csc.fi/img/csc-quick-reference/csc-quick-reference.pdf

## Service names

* Puhti, Mahti, LUMI - supercomputers
* Pouta, Rahti - cloud services
* Allas - object storage

## Unix commands
(all text within <> is replaced with real names, e.g. `cp /home/user/my-file.txt scratch/project_200xxxx/new-directory`)
Check out all options of the commands with `man <command>` (for *man*ual), exit with `q`.

* `ls` - list current directory contents
* `cp <file-to-copy> <destination>` - copy a file 
* `mv <file-to-move> <destination/new-file-name>` - move or rename a file 
* `rm <file-to-remove>` - delete a file 
* `cd <directory-to-change-to>` - change the current directory
    * `cd ..` - change to "one level higher" in directory tree
    * `cd` - (without argument) change to $HOME 
* `pwd` - print full path of the current directory
* `mkdir <new-directory-name>` - create a directory
* `touch <new-file-name>` - create an empty new file
* `chmod <whowhatwhich> <file-name>` - change file permissions 
    * who -> u: user , g: group , o: others, a: all
    * what -> -:remove permission, +: add permission
    * which -> r: read, w: write, x: execute
    * example `chmod u+x my-batch-job-script.sh` adds execution rights for current user to the file
* `chgrp` - change file/folder owner
* `less <text-file>` - see text file (exit with `q`)
* `cat <file-name>` - see file content
* `head <file-name>` - list ten first lines of the file 
* `tail -100 <file-name>` - show the last 100 lines 
* `history` - show history of commands run
* `grep` - find rows containing a string
    * example: `history | grep "some strings"` would show you all commands in your history that contain "some string" (| is called a pipe)
* `echo "some text"` - prints some text to terminal
* `exit` - quit the session on commandline 
* `<some command> > <file-name>` - output of a command to a file 
* `<some command> >> <file-name>` - append output of a command to a file

## Command line editors 

### Nano
Process to edit a file in nano:
* `nano <file-name>` - (create and) open file with nano
    * edit your file
    * when done, use `CTRL + o` key combination

    * press `:wq` to save (*w*rite) the file and exit (*q*uit) the editor

## File transfer

* `scp <file name> <username@puhti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_200xxxx/dir_name>` - copy a file from one computer to another, here: to Puhti
* `wget <some-url>` or  `curl <some-url>` - get a file from the internet

## CSC modules

* Geoinformatics applications and how to use them: https://docs.csc.fi/apps/by_discipline/#geosciences
* `module load <application-name>` - initialize the environment of an application
* `module list` - list loaded applications
* `module purge` - remove application environments

## CSC batch jobs

* `sbatch <batch-job-file>` - submit a job
* `sacct` - info about job status
* `squeue` - see the job status in the queue
* `scancel <jobid>` - cancel a job
* `seff <jobid>` - info about completed jobs
